BASE CONTENT TO ADD:
	- Invaders... check out vanilla common EMEVD for suspicious flags that might need to be enabled.
		Candidates:
			- 702 (enabled in Kiln if 11800210 (Lordvessel full) is off, which is always true here).
				- Could explain why invasions were being blocked in the Kiln specifically.
			- 8000 (does something unknown in Common).
			- 765 (enabled if you're offline).
			
	- Remove vanilla models from MSBs to make room for the real ones.
	
TEST:
	- New Catacombs arena.
	- Artorias arena in Township.
	- Township shortcut elevator when starting at the bottom.
	- New Fortress gate arena (and gate opening event).
	
CHANGES:
	- Add a "speed boost" buff at the old Ceaseless fog gate (last five seconds).
		- Have boss battle trigger remove the buff.

LOW PRIORITY:
	- Record Cast Light head effects and inject into m12_01 EMEVD event for opening special light door.
	- Can't find an event or ID for Sen's illusory wall, to make it invincible.
		- For the best now, since there's a boss battle up there.
	- Add a Nito sword event to every map, then add a call to the constructor (with Nito's ID as an argument)
	  only if Nito is in that map (just check for bosses and Very Rare enemies).
	- Andre's default animation is his boxer pose...
		- Give him and Vamos an offset anvil if possible (load object and place at offset relative to facing angle).
	- Have locked doors tell you which key they need.
	- Fist-based weapons have no icon and no weight. Probably prevent Fists from being a model base.
	- Add Paintings. At least one for each map, shouldn't take long. (And get Anor Londo one working the same way.)
		- ONLY release if the Painted World "bonus" system works fine with spawn points, quitting, etc.
